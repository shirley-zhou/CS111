<h1>Lab 1. Simpleton shell</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>You are a programmer for Big Data Systems, Inc., a company that
specializes in large backend systems that analyze
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data">big data</a>. Much of
BDSI's computation occurs in a cloud or a grid. Computational nodes are cheap
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_multiprocessing">SMP</a>
hosts with a relatively small number of processors. Nodes typically
run simple shell scripts as part of the larger computation, and you've
been assigned the job of improving the infrastructure for these
scripts.</p>

<p>Many of the shell scripts have command sequences that look like the
following (though the actual commands tend to be more proprietary):</p>

<pre><code>(sort &lt; a | cat b - | tr A-Z a-z &gt; c) 2&gt;&gt; d
</code></pre>

<p>This command invokes three subcommands. The first runs the
command <samp>sort</samp> with standard input being the
file <samp>a</samp> and standard output being a unnamed pipe 1.  The
second runs the command <samp>cat b -</samp> with standard input being
pipe 1 and standard output being pipe 2. The third runs the
command <samp>tr A-Z a-z</samp> with standard input being pipe 2 and
standard output being the file <samp>c</samp>. All three commands have
standard error sent, via the same file descriptor, to
file <samp>d</samp> in append-only mode.</p>

<p>BDSI's developers have several complaints about these shell scripts:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The shell script syntax does not let them open files with
    special flags available at the system call level. For example,
    there is no way to open a file with the <samp>O_DSYNC</samp> flag
    of
    the <samp><a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/open.html">open</a></samp>
    system call.</li>

  <li>The developers want to be able to create arbitrary directed graphs
    of processes connected via pipes, but the shell syntax forces them
    into pipelines.</li>

  <li>The developers want a simpler way to invoke the shell, one that
    is more easily generated from their programs and scripts, one that
    does not require that they write a shell script. They do not mind
    if the simpler shell is harder for humans to use, because it's
    not intended to be used directly by programmers.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Basic idea</h2>

<p>To address these issues, your boss proposes a new
program <samp>simpsh</samp>, short for "SIMPleton SHell", a very simple,
stripped down shell. <samp>simpsh</samp> does not use a scripting
language at all, and you do not interact with it at a terminal or give
it a script to run. Instead, developers invoke the <samp>simpsh</samp>
command by passing it arguments telling it which files to access,
which pipes to create, and which subcommands to invoke. It then
creates or accesses all the files and creates all the pipes processes
needed to run the subcommands, and reports the processes's exit
statuses as they exit.</p>

<p>For example, the abovementioned command in the standard shell could
  be run using the following <samp>simpsh</samp> command. This invocation
  uses standard shell syntax, because it is invoking <samp>simpsh</samp> from
  the standard shell; the command itself, though, is just an array of strings
  and <samp>simpsh</samp> interprets this array and executes the same three
  subcommands that the abovementioned shell command does.</p>

<pre><code>simpsh \
  --rdonly a \
  --pipe \
  --pipe \
  --creat --trunc --wronly c \
  --creat --append --wronly d \
  --command 3 5 6 tr A-Z a-z \
  --command 0 2 6 sort \
  --command 1 4 6 cat b - \
  --wait
</code></pre>

<p>This example invocation creates seven file descriptors:</p>
<ol start="0">
  <li>A read only descriptor for the file <samp>a</samp>, created by the <samp>--rdonly</samp> option.</li>
  <li>The read end of the first pipe, created by the first <samp>--pipe</samp> option.</li>
  <li>The write end of the first pipe, also created by the first <samp>--pipe</samp> option.</li>
  <li>The read end of the second pipe, created by the second <samp>--pipe</samp> option.</li>
  <li>The write end of the second pipe, also created by the second <samp>--pipe</samp> option.</li>
  <li>A write only descriptor for the file <samp>c</samp>, created by the first <samp>--wronly</samp> option as modified by the preceding <samp>--creat</samp> and <samp>--trunc</samp>.</li>
  <li>A write only, append only descriptor for the
  file <samp>d</samp>, created by the <samp>--wronly</samp>
  option as modified by the preceding <samp>--creat</samp> and <samp>--append</samp> options.</li>
</ol>

<p> It then creates three subprocesses:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A subprocess with standard input, standard output, and standard
  error being the file descriptors numbered 0, 2, and 6 above,
  respectively. This subprocess runs the command <samp>sort</samp>
  with no arguments</li>
  <li>A subprocess with standard input, output, and error being the file
  descriptors numbered 1, 3, and 6. This subprocess runs the
  command <samp>cat</samp> with the two arguments <samp>b</samp>
  and <samp>-</samp>.</li>
  <li>A subprocess with standard, standard, and error being the file
  descriptors numberd 4, 5, and 6 above. This subprocess runs the
  command <samp>tr</samp> with the two arguments <samp>A-Z</samp>
  and <samp>a-z</samp>.</li>
  </ul>

<p>It then waits for all three subprocesses to finish. As each
finishes, it prints its exit status, followed by the command and
  arguments. The output might look like this:</p>

<pre><samp>0 sort
0 cat b -
0 tr A-Z a-z
</samp></pre>

<p>although not necessarily in that order, depending on which order
the subprocesses finished.</p>

<h2><samp>simpsh</samp> options</h2>

<p>Here is a detailed list of the command-line options
  that <samp>simpsh</samp> should support. Each option should be
  executed in sequence, left to right.</p>

<p>First are the file flags. These flags affect the next file that is
opened. They are ignored if no later file is opened. Each file flag
corresponds to an <var>oflag</var> value of
<samp><a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/open.html">open</a></samp>;
the corresponding <var>oflag</var> value is listed after the
option. Also
see <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Opening-and-Closing-Files.html">Opening
and Closing Files</a>
and <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Open_002dtime-Flags.html">Open-time
Flags</a>.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><samp>--append</samp></dt><dd><samp>O_APPEND</samp></dd>
  <dt><samp>--cloexec</samp></dt><dd><samp>O_CLOEXEC</samp></dd>
  <dt><samp>--creat</samp></dt><dd><samp>O_CREAT</samp></dd>
  <dt><samp>--directory</samp></dt><dd><samp>O_DIRECTORY</samp></dd>
  <dt><samp>--dsync</samp></dt><dd><samp>O_DSYNC</samp></dd>
  <dt><samp>--excl</samp></dt><dd><samp>O_EXCL</samp></dd>
  <dt><samp>--nofollow</samp></dt><dd><samp>O_NOFOLLOW</samp></dd>
  <dt><samp>--nonblock</samp></dt><dd><samp>O_NONBLOCK</samp></dd>
  <dt><samp>--rsync</samp></dt><dd><samp>O_RSYNC</samp></dd>
  <dt><samp>--sync</samp></dt><dd><samp>O_SYNC</samp></dd>
  <dt><samp>--trunc</samp></dt><dd><samp>O_TRUNC</samp></dd>
</dl>

<p>Second are the file-opening options. These flags open files. Each
  file-opening option also corresponds to an <var>oflag</var> value, listed
  after the option. Each opened file is given a file number; file numbers
  start at 0 and increment after each file-opening option. Normally they
  increment by 1, but the <samp>--pipe</samp> option causes them to
  increment by 2.</p>

<dl>
  <dt><samp>--rdonly <var>f</var></samp></dt>
  <dd><samp>O_RDONLY</samp>. Open the file <var>f</var> for reading only.</dd>

  <dt><samp>--rdwr <var>f</var></samp></dt>
  <dd><samp>O_RDWR</samp>. Open the file <var>f</var> for reading and
    writing.</dd>

  <dt><samp>--wronly <var>f</var></samp></dt>
  <dd><samp>O_WRONLY</samp>. Open the file <var>f</var> for writing only.</dd>

  <dt><samp>--pipe</samp></dt>
<dd>Open a pipe. Unlike the other file options, this option does not
  take an argument. Also, it consumes file numbers, not just one.</dd>
</dl>

<p> Third is the subcommand options:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><samp>--command <var>i o e cmd args</var></samp></dt>
  <dd>Execute a command with standard input <var>i</var>, standard output
    <var>o</var> and standard error <var>e</var>; these values should correspond
    to earlier file or pipe options. The executable for the command
    is <var>cmd</var> and it has zero or more arguments <var>args</var>.
    None of the <var>cmd</var> and <var>args</var> operands begin
    with the two characters "<samp>--</samp>".</dd>

  <dt><samp>--wait</samp></dt>
  <dd>Wait for all commands to finish. As each finishes, output its exit
    status, and a copy of the command (with spaces separating arguments)
    to standard output.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Finally, there are some miscellaneous options:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><samp>--close <var>N</var></samp></dt>
  <dd>Close the <var>N</var>th file that was opened by a file-opening
    option. For a pipe, this closes just one end of the pipe. Once
    file <var>N</var> is closed, it is an error to access it, just
    as it is an error to access any file number that has never
    been opened. File numbers are not reused by later file-opening
    options.</dd>

  <dt><samp>--verbose</samp></dt>
  <dd>Just before executing an option, output a line to standard output
    containing the option. If the option has operands, list them
    separated by spaces. Ensure that the line is actually output, and
    is not merely sitting in a buffer somewhere.</dd>

  <dt><samp>--profile</samp></dt>
  <dd>Just after executing an option, output a line to standard output
    containing the resources used. Use <samp><a href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/getrusage.html">getrusage</a> and
    output a line containing as much useful information as you can
    glean from it.</samp>

  </dd><dt><samp>--abort</samp></dt>
  <dd>Crash the shell. The shell itself should immediately dump core,
  via a segmentation violation.</dd>

  <dt><samp>--catch <var>N</var></samp></dt>
  <dd>Catch signal <var>N</var>, where <var>N</var> is a decimal
    integer, with a handler that outputs the
    diagnostic <samp><var>N</var> caught</samp> to stderr, and exits
    with status <var>N</var>. This exits the entire shell. <var>N</var>
    uses the same numbering as your system; for example, on GNU/Linux,
    a segmentation violation is signal 11.</dd>

  <dt><samp>--ignore <var>N</var></samp></dt>
  <dd>Ignore signal <var>N</var>.</dd>

  <dt><samp>--default <var>N</var></samp></dt>
  <dd>Use the default behavior for signal <var>N</var>.</dd>

  <dt><samp>--pause</samp></dt>
  <dd>Pause, waiting for a signal to arrive.</dd>
</dl>

<p>When there is a syntax error in an option (e.g., a missing
operand), or where a file cannot be opened, or where is some other
error in a system call, <samp>simpsh</samp> should report a diagnostic
to standard error and should continue to the next option. However,
<samp>simpsh</samp> should ignore any write errors to standard error,
so that it does not get into an infinite loop outputting write-error
diagnostics.</p>

<p>When <samp>simpsh</samp> exits other than in response to a signal,
it should exit with status equal to the maximum of all the exit
statuses of all the subcommands that it ran and successfully waited
for. However, if there are no such subcommands, or if the maximum is
zero, <samp>simpsh</samp> should exit with status 0 if all options
succeeded, and with status 1 one of them failed. For example, if a
file could not be opened, <samp>simpsh</samp> must exit with nonzero
status.</p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<p>Your implementation will take three phases:</p><p>
</p><ul>
  <li>In Lab 1a, you'll warm up by implementing just the options
    <samp>--rdonly</samp>, <samp>--wronly</samp>, <samp>--command</samp>,
    and <samp>--verbose</samp>.</li>

  <li>In Lab 1b, you'll implement the rest of the options,
    except for <samp>--profile</samp>.</li>

  <li>In Lab 1c, you'll implement <samp>--profile</samp> and
    compare the performance of your implementation
    to that of <samp>bash</samp> and that
    of <samp><a href="http://skarnet.org/software/execline/">execline</a></samp>.</li>
  </ul>

<p>Before charging ahead and implementing, you should be familiar with
  the man pages for
  <samp>close</samp>,
  <samp>dup2</samp>,
  <samp>execvp</samp>,
  <samp>fork</samp>,
  <samp>getopt_long</samp>,
  <samp>open</samp>,
  <samp>pipe</samp>, and
  <samp>sigaction</samp>.

</p><p>Your program should come with a file named <samp>Makefile</samp>
that supports the following actions.</p>

<ul>
<li>'<code>make</code>' builds the <code>simpsh</code> program.</li>
<li>'<code>make clean</code>' removes the program and all other temporary files
and object files that can be regenerated with '<code>make</code>'.</li>
<li>'<code>make check</code>' tests the <code>simpsh</code> program
on test cases that you design. You should have at least three test cases.</li>
<li>'<code>make dist</code>' makes a software distribution compressed
tarball <code>lab1-<var>yourname</var>.tar.gz</code> and does some
simple testing on it. This tarball is what you should submit via
CCLE. All the files in the tarball should have names of the form
<code>lab1-<var>yourname</var>/...</code> and one of the files should
be <code>lab1-<var>yourname</var>/Makefile</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your solution should be written in the C programming language.
Your code should be <a href="http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Semantics.html">robust</a>, for example, it should not impose an arbitrary
limit like 2<sup>16</sup> bytes on the length of a string. You
may use the features
of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C11_%28C_standard_revision%29">C11</a>
as implemented on the SEASnet GNU/Linux servers running RHEL 7. Please prepend the
directory <code>/usr/local/cs/bin</code> to your PATH, to get the
versions of the tools that we will use to test your solution. Your
solution should stick to the
standard <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/">GNU C library</a>
that is installed on SEASnet, and should not rely on other
libraries.</p>

<p>You can test your program by running it directly.
Eventually, you should put your own
test cases into a file <code>test.sh</code> and
run it automatically as part of '<code>make check</code>'.</p>

<h2>Submit</h2>

<p>After you implement Lab 1a, submit via CCLE
the <code>.tar.gz</code> file that is built by '<code>make
dist</code>'. Similarly for 1b and 1c. Your submission should contain
a README file that briefly describes known limitations of your code
and any extra features you'd like to call our attention to.</p>

<p>We will check your work on each lab part by running it on the
SEASnet GNU/Linux servers, so make sure they work on there. Lab 1 parts
are due at different times, but we will not grade each part
separately; the lab grade is determined by your overall work on all
three parts.</p>

<h2>Design problem ideas</h2>

<p>Here are some suggestions for design problems, if you have been
assigned a design problem for Lab 1. You may implement one of them, or
design your own. If you design your own, get approval from us before
committing significant work to it. Your implementations should include
test cases.</p>

<p>For Lab 1a:</p>
<ul>
<li>The ability to read from a script rather than just the command line.
The script should have the same flexibility as the command line.</li>
<li>Control structures equivalent to the
shell's <code>&amp;&amp;</code>, <code>||</code>, <code>if</code>, <code>while</code>, <code>case</code>, <code>for</code>,
and <code>!</code>.</li>
<li>Make your shell interactive, with a prompt, and command-line
editing, and tab completion, and have it do something reasonable when
you type control-C. You can use the GNU readline library for
this.</li>
</ul>

<p>For Lab 1b:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Allow flags to apply to pipes as well, when appropriate.
    For example, the <samp>--nonblock</samp> flag. Investigate
    which flags are appropriate.</li>
  <li>Extend the shell to wait for individual subcommands,
    instead of waiting for them all to finish.</li>
  <li>Investigate what happens when you create a cycle in the
    directed graph of pipes in your subprocesses. Detect and
    prevent such cycles from causing problems.</li>
</ul>

<p>For Lab 1c:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Write a program to translate from standard shell format
  to <samp>simpsh</samp>, or vice versa.</li>
  <li>Compare two or three other shells' performances too, e.g., Dash,
    Tcsh.</li>
  <li>Limit the amount of parallelism to at most <var>N</var>
subprocesses, where <var>N</var> is a parameter that you can set by an
argument to the shell.</li>
</ul>
